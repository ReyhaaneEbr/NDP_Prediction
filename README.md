#🧬 NDP_Prediction
Graph Attention Network for Neurodegenerative Disease Protein Classification

#📌 Overview
NDP_Prediction is a graph-based 🧠 machine learning project that applies Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to identify Neurodegenerative Disease-Related Proteins (NDPs).

The model distinguishes disease-related proteins from Housekeeping proteins, focusing on four major neurodegenerative diseases:

🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
🧠 Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
🧠 Huntington’s Disease (HD)
🧠 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
#🧪 Data Collection & Labeling
##🧬 Disease-Associated Proteins
Disease–gene associations were retrieved from DisGeNET
Disease-specific proteins were curated for AD, PD, HD, and ALS
Gene identifiers were mapped to UniProtKB IDs using the UniProt ID Mapping API
##🧫 Housekeeping Proteins
Housekeeping proteins were selected as negative controls
Labels:
1 → Disease-associated protein
0 → Housekeeping protein
✅ The final labeled dataset is stored as:
data/dataset.xlsx
#🧬 Feature Representation
##🧠 Protein Sequence Embeddings
Protein sequences were encoded using ProtT5 (Rostlab)
Each protein sequence is represented as a 1024-dimensional embedding
Mean pooling was applied over residue-level embeddings to obtain a fixed-length vector per protein
##🧩 Graph Construction
Nodes represent proteins
Edges represent protein–protein interactions (PPI)
Node features correspond to ProtT5 embeddings
#🧠 Model Architecture
The prediction model is based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT):

🔹 Input layer: ProtT5 embeddings (1024 features)
🔹 Hidden layers: Multi-head self-attention
🔹 Output layer: Binary classification (NDP vs. Housekeeping)
🔹 Attention mechanism highlights disease-informative proteins
